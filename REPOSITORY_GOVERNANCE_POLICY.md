# Philanthro Capital Ventures — Repository Governance Policy (v1.0)

## Purpose
This policy defines the structure, review process, and approval hierarchy for all repositories managed under the Philanthro Capital Ventures (PCV) GitHub organization.

## 1. Repository Ownership
Each repository must have:
- **Primary Maintainer** — responsible for project direction and merge approvals.
- **Contributor(s)** — individuals with Write access, responsible for implementing changes via pull requests.
- **Administrator (PCV President)** — retains ultimate approval authority for protected branches and release versions.

## 2. Branch Protection
All primary repositories (e.g., `pcv-transparency-platform`) must enforce:
- Protection of the `main` branch.
- Required pull request reviews before merging.
- Disallowed force pushes and deletions.
- Automatic checks for compliance with PCV’s security and privacy standards.

## 3. Version Control
- Each major change must be tagged as `vX.Y`.
- Documents and policies must include version and date at the footer.
- Prior versions are archived in the `/docs/archive/` directory.

## 4. Change Approval Process
1. Contributors submit pull requests for code or policy updates.
2. The Primary Maintainer reviews for accuracy and compliance.
3. The PCV President (Admin) provides final approval before merge.

## 5. Audit Trail
All commits must be traceable to individual GitHub accounts with 2FA enabled.
Automated logs shall be reviewed quarterly for unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts.
