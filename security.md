## 2. Adjusting Visibility and Privacy

**To control profile visibility:**
1. Navigate to **Settings → Public Profile**
2. Remove or replace *Location* text (e.g., “California, USA”)
3. Check **“Keep my email address private”**
4. Edit or shorten your *Bio* as needed

**To change repository visibility:**
- Go to the repository (e.g., *pcv-transparency-platform*)  
- Click **Settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility → Private/Public**  
- Confirm by typing the repository name

**To manage collaborators:**
- Go to **Settings → Manage Access → Add People**  
- Assign roles:
  - **Read** – View only  
  - **Write** – Push code and create branches  
  - **Maintain** – Manage branches, pull requests, and teams  
  - **Admin** – Full control (owners only)

## 3. Security Recommendations

All PCV contributors must enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** using:
- Hardware Security Key (e.g., YubiKey)
- Authenticator App (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy)
- GitHub Mobile

**To verify 2FA:**
Go to **Settings → Password and Authentication → Two-Factor Authentication**

---

## 4. Organizational and Developer Access

When working with external developers (e.g., **Web5 Nexus**):

- Add each developer individually (never shared accounts)
- Assign **Write** access for contributors and **Maintain** access for team leads
- The repository owner retains **Admin** control
- Enable branch protection rules under  
  **Settings → Branches → Add Rule → Protect main branch**

## 5. Transparency vs. Privacy Balance

While PCV promotes open-source accountability, **private or legally sensitive information** (such as IRS filings, donor data, or financial records) must never be posted publicly.  
Use **encrypted storage or private cloud systems** for all confidential documents.

---

## 6. Revision Control

This policy will be reviewed annually or upon major platform or organizational changes.  
All revisions must be approved by the **PCV President** or authorized delegate.
